# Detect Melanoma 
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. 
It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma 
has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis - Aaccuracy of the model for the Training data set is about 79%. But the Validation accuracy doesnt appear to be similar
  as it only about 55%. The validation loss as observed is very high. This indicates that there is overfit in the model
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis - The model accuracy for Train data is about 35% and the accuracy for the Validation set is also at 36%. Much better model
  compared to the previous two models as there seems to be No Overfit.And this proves that Data Augmentation has improved the model performance.
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis - The training accuracy is about 92%. The validation accuracy is nearly 76%. We have solved the overfitting , 
  underfitting andclass imbalance issue. Much better models could be built or tried out using more epochs and more layer
